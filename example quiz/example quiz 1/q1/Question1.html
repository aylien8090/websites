      <h1>Radio Frequency Interference at the ATCA</h1>

      <p>The radio spectrum that is most often used by radio astronomers to 
        observe the universe (frequencies of a few GHz) is also widely used by modern 
        technology, leading to interference. Radio telescopes are very sensitive detectors 
        of radio waves, so man-made devices that emit radio waves are easily seen. Although these 
        devices are far less powerful than the jets of plasma emanating from a supermassive black 
        hole in a distant galaxy, they are far, far closer.</p>

      Since most interference is man-made, it follows the human population. 
      Thus, remote areas might be expected to have less interference. The 
      <strong>Australia Telescope Compact Array</strong> <a href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/">(ATCA)</a> is 20km away from Narrabri, in a 
      shire of only 14000 people. Nevertheless, radio frequency interference is a major problem.
