                The OAIC received 396 notifications this reporting period.
                This is a 14% decrease compared to the previous 6 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was significant variation month to month in the
                number of notifications received. The lowest monthly total
                was 47 notifications in <strong><mark>January and the highest was 82 notifications
                        in May. January 2021 is the only other month since the scheme began
                        in which the OAIC received fewer than 50 notifications</mark>.</strong>

                In this reporting period, there was an
                increase in data breaches that reportedly
                impacted a larger number of Australians.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were 24 data breaches reported to
                affect 5,000 or more Australians, compared with 18
                breaches of this scale in July to December 2021. Four
                of these breaches were reported to affect 100,000 or
                more Australians, compared with one breach in the previous
                reporting period.

            <p>Twenty-three of the 24 breaches that affected
                more than 5,000 Australians were caused by cyber
                incidents, with the remaining breach resulting from
                a system fault. Nine were ransomware incidents, 9 were
                due to compromised credentials, 3 were due to hacking
                and 2 were malware incidents.
            </p>
            <p>
                This underlines the significant impact of cyber incidents
                on individuals in this reporting period, and the importance
                of entities taking appropriate protective measures against a
                range of cyber threats.

                has useful guidance for entities on improving their cyber resilience and
                protecting the personal information they hold from cyber threats.
