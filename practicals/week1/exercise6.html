                Consistent with previous reports, malicious or criminal attack
                was the largest source of data breaches notified to the OAIC,
                accounting for 250 breaches (down from 253).
            </p>
            <p>
                Human error remained a major source of breaches, accounting for
                131 notifications (down from 189).

            <p>
                The number of breaches attributed to a malicious or criminal
                attack decreased by 1%. The proportion of total breaches caused
                by malicious or criminal attack increased from 55% to 63%.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of breaches (65%) in this category involved
                cyber incidents (162 notifications).
            </p>
            <p>
                Social engineering or impersonation accounted for 58
                notifications, theft of paperwork or data storage device for
                17 notifications and actions taken by a rogue employee or insider
                threat for 13 notifications.

            <p>
                In this reporting period, 65% of breaches attributed to malicious
                or criminal attack - or 41% of all breaches (162 notifications)
                - resulted from cyber security incidents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of breaches (65%) in this category involved
                The top sources of cyber incidents were ransomware (51 notifications),
                phishing (42 notifications) and compromised or stolen credentials
                (method unknown) (40 notifications).
            </p>
            <p>
                Just over half (54%) of cyber incidents involved malicious actors
                gaining access to accounts using compromised or stolen credentials.

            <h2 id="HE">Human Error</h2>
            <p>
                The reporting period saw a significant decrease in human error
                breaches in terms of the total number of notifications -
                down 31% from 189 to 131 - and proportionally â€“ down from
                41% to 33% of all breaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just over half (54%) of human error breaches involved personal
                information being sent to the wrong recipient either by email,
                mail, fax or another method.

            <h2 id="SF">System Faults</h2>
            <p>
                System fault breaches include incidents that occur due to a
                business or technology process error and accounted for 4% of
                all notifications. The proportion of breaches attributed to
                system faults has been consistent since the NDB scheme began.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unintended release or publication of personal information due
                to a system fault caused 11 breaches. Unintended access to personal
                information because of a system fault caused 4 breaches.
