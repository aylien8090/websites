    <p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) periodically publishes 
        <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches/notifiable-data-breaches-statistics">statistical information</a>
        about notifications received under the 
        <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches">Notifiable Data Breaches</a> 
        to help entities and the public understand privacy risks identified through the scheme. This report captures notifications 
        made under the NDB scheme from 1 January to 30 June 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
        Statistical comparisons are to the period 1 July to 31 December 2021 unless otherwise indicated.
    </p>
    <p>Percentages in charts may not total 100% due to rounding.</p>
    <p>
        Where data breaches affect multiple entities,
        the OAIC may receive multiple notificationsrelating
        to the same incident. Notifications relating to the same incident
        are countedas a single notification in this report unless 
        otherwise specified.

    </p>
    <p>
        The source of any given breach is based on information provided 
        by the reporting entity. Where more than one source has been identified 
        or is possible, the dominant or most likely source has been selected.
        Source of breachcategories are defined in the glossary at the end of this report.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notifications made under the My Health Records Act 2012 are not included as they 
        are subject to specific notification requirements set out in that Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        Statistics in this report are current as of 30 September 2022. Some data breach 
        notifications are being assessed and adjustments may be made to related statistics. 
        This may affect statistics for the period January to June 2022 published in future reports. 
        Similarly, statistics from before January 2022 in this report may differ from statistics 
        published in previous NDB reports.

    <p>
        The NDB scheme was established in February 2018 to improve consumer protection and drive better 
        security standards for protecting personal information. Under the scheme, any organisation or 
        government agency covered by the 
        <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/rights-and-responsibilities/?stage=Stage#OrgAndAgencyPrivacyActCovers">Privacy Act 1988</a>
        that experiences an eligible data breach must notify affected individuals and the OAIC.
    </p>
    <p>
        The OAIC publishes twice-yearly reports on notifications received under the 
        NDB scheme to track the leading sources of data breaches and highlight emerging 
        issues and areas for ongoing attention by regulated entities.
